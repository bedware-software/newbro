# Build Newbro, reinstall it over the local prod install and relaunch it (Windows).

#   scripts\prod-iter.ps1 [commit message]
#
# The order is deliberate. Commit first: the husky pre-commit hook bumps the patch version,
# and that number is the only way to tell the new build from the old one. Build while Newbro
# keeps running (the build only writes to out\ and release\). Stop it only for the few
# seconds the install takes. Push last, once the new build is running.
#
# Get-Process Newbro matches only the installed app: an `npm run dev` instance runs as
# electron.exe and is never touched.
